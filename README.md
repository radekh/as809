_Traditional Assembler for Motorola M6809_

This is assembler for microprocessor M6809 from Motorola.  It's based on old source from Masataka Ohta, and Hiroshi Tezuka.

I choosed this one because of traditional syntax and also because of simplicity.  This allows me to assembly old code and also learn on the assembler by modifying it.
